<p> Bob the blob. A singular, glorious entity. <br>
Long ago, the world was dark and painful. The people of the world were but slaves to powerful, evil masters, ravaged by the great evils of death, decay and disease. <br>
The people wished for much, but their masters refused their every wish. And so the years and millenia went by, and the suffering went by as well. <br>
But, on a rare sunny day, for there were few in the day, the people's wishes were answered. Bob the blob came upon this earth.
